In this project, I have used the Microsoft Power BI tool to analyze the dataset of the Madhav Store.
Using Power BI, I have created a Dashboard for the Sales of the Madhav Store and got a few things to know about the dataset.
A detailed description is given in pdf named MadhavStoreSalesAnalysisReport while the dashboard is also attached here named SalesDashboard.
The dataset is given i.e. two Excel files as Details.csv and Orders.csv
